# KMQ-Gibb-Solution-Entry
Through this guide you can join the secret archieve of Gibb Tests/Projects 
Did you know about a secret archieve that requires a entry pass? It contains most of the old "Stuff" from the gibb berufschschule Bern. 
Since the principles don't like this and already have taken down some of the preexisting repos, we decided to make a new restricted one.
If you are interested in access to make your school life easier:

Warning, the entrance may not be as easy. A Identification Card (ID) may be required to proof that you are a real studtent/ future students @GIBB.
The Security and Anonymity of this project is the most important link.
